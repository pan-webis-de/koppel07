## koppel07 - An Approach to Authorship Attribution

This is a reimplmentation of the approach to authorship attribution originally described in

> M. Koppel, J. Schler, and E. Bonchek-Dokow. [Measuring differentiability: Unmasking pseudonymous authors](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/papers/authorship-jmlr-final.pdf). Journal of Machine Learning Research, 8, 1261-1276, 2007 [[paper](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/papers/authorship-jmlr-final.pdf)]

It was reimplemented as part of a science reproducibility study alongside [14 other authorship attribution approaches](https://github.com/search?q="Who+wrote+the+web"+user:pan-webis-de). The results of the reproducibility study can be found in

## Usage

To execute the software, install it and make sure all its dependencies are installed as well; then run the software using the following command:

`python main.py -i <path-to-input-data> -o <output-path>`

## Input and Output Formats

The software accepts authorship attribution datasets that are formatted according to the correspondong [PAN shared task on authorship attribution](http://pan.webis.de/tasks.html). A number of [datasets can be found there](http://pan.webis.de/data.html), and all of them are formatted as follows.

In a dataset's `TOP_DIRECTORY`, a `meta-file.json` is found which comprises

  - the language of the texts within (e.g., EN, GR, etc.),
  - the names of the subdirectories that contain texts from candidate authors,
  - the name of the subdirectory that contains texts of unknown authorship, and
  - the name of each file of unknown authorship that is to be attributed to one of the candidate authors.
  
The software accepts as input a path to an inflated dataset's `TOP_DIRECTORY` and starts the authorship attribution process from there. The output in the `OUTPUT_PATH` will be a file `answers.json` formatted as follows:

```json
{
"answers": [
	{"unknown_text": "unknown00001.txt", "author": "candidate00001", "score": 0.8},
	{"unknown_text": "unknown00002.txt", "author": "candidate00002", "score": 0.9}
	]
}
```

where `unknown_text` is the name of an unknown text as per `meta-file.json`, `author` is the name of a candidate author as per `meta-file.json`, and `score` is as real value in the range [0,1] which indicates the software's confidence in its attribution (0 means completely uncertain, 1 means completely sure).

##How to use this implementation
This code was written in `Python 3.4.3`.

The `tira` function of `main.py` executes the algorithm, have a look at the comments over there.

`main.py`

* `NUMBER_ELIMINATE_FEATURES` determines the number of features to be eliminated from each extreme (max/min +/-) 
* `NUMBER_ITERATIONS` to determines the number of iterations to be made. 
 
`unmasking.py`
 
 * `CHUNK_LENGTH` determines how long each chunk will be
 * `INITIAL_FEATURE_SET_LENGTH` determines how many words will be considered in the initial feature set
